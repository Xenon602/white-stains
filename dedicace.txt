You crown me king and queen.
There is a name for whose soft sound I would abandon all this pomp.
I liefer would have had you call some soft sweet title of beloved shame.
Gold coronets be seemly, but bright flame I choose for diadem; I would let fall all crowns, all kingdoms, for one rhythmical caress of thine, one kiss my soul to tame.

You crown me king and queen; I crown thee lover!
I bid thee hasten, nay, I plead with thee, come in the thick dear darkness to my bed.
Heed not my sighs, but eagerly uncover, as our mouths mingle, my sweet infamy, and rob thy lover of his maidenhead.

Lie close; no pity, but a little love.
Kiss me but once and all my pain is paid.
Hurt me or soothe, stretch out one limb above like a strong man who would constrain a maid.
Touch me; I shudder and my lips turn back over my shoulder if so be that thus my mouth may find thy mouth, if aught there lack to thy desire, till love is one with us.

God! I shall faint with pain, I hide my face for shame.
I am disturbed, I cannot rise, I breathe hard with thy breath; thy quick embrace crushes; thy teeth are agony - pain dies in deadly passion.
Ah! you come - you kill me!
Christ! God! Bite! Bite! Ah Bite! Love's fountains fill me.
